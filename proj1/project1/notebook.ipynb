    "$$ f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\alpha_i\\cdot y_i\\cdot\\mathrm{K}(x,x_i)+b,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know the intuition behind a linear discriminant function, the non-parametric SVM classifier above is very easy to understand. Instead of imagining the original features of each data point, consider a transformation to a new feature space where the data point has $N$ features, one for each support vector. The value of the $i^{th}$ feature is equal to the value of the kernel between the $i^{th}$ support vector and the data point is classified. The original (possibly non-linear) SVM classifier is like any other linear discriminant in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that after the transformation, the original features of the data point are irrelevant. Its dot products with support vectors (special data points chosen by the SVM optimization algorithm) represent it only. One of my professors used a loose analogy while explaining this idea: A person has seen lakes, rivers, streams, fords, etc., but has never seen the sea. How would you explain to this person what a sea is? By relating the amount of water in an ocean to that found in a water body, the person already knows, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances, like the RBF kernel, defining the transformed features in terms of the original features of a data point leads to an infinite-dimensional representation. Unfortunately, though this an awe-inspiring fact often mentioned while explaining how powerful SVMs are, it drops in only after repeated encounters with the idea ranging from introductory machine learning to statistical learning theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other kernel, we can understand the RBF kernel regarding feature transformation via the dot products given above. However, the intuition that helps best when analyzing the RBF kernel is that of the Gaussian distribution (as provided by [Akihiro Matsukawa](https://www.quora.com/profile/Akihiro-Matsukawa)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian kernel computed with a support vector is an exponentially decaying function in the input feature space, the maximum value of which is attained at the support vector and which decays uniformly in all directions around the support vector, leading to hyper-spherical contours of the kernel function. The SVM classifier with the Gaussian kernel is simply a weighted linear combination of the kernel function computed between a data point and each support vector. The role of a support vector in the classification of a data point gets tempered with $\\alpha$, the global prediction usefulness of the support vector, and $\\mathrm{K}(x,y)$, the local influence of a support vector in prediction at a particular data point.\n",
    "\n",

    "(This comes from learning theory, it could be more intuitive, but good to know.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian kernels are universal kernels, i.e., their use with appropriate regularization guarantees a globally optimal predictor, which minimizes a classifier's estimation and approximation errors. Here, we incur approximation error by limiting the space of classification models over which the search space. Estimation error refers to errors in estimating the model parameters.\n"

    "The Gaussian kernel computed with a support vector is an exponentially decaying function in the input feature space, the maximum value of which is attained at the support vector and which decays uniformly in all directions around the support vector, leading to hyper-spherical contours of the kernel function. The SVM classifier with the Gaussian kernel is simply a weighted linear combination of the kernel function computed between a data point and each support vector. The role of a support vector in the classification of a data point gets tempered with $\\alpha$, the global prediction usefulness of the support vector, and $\\mathrm{K}(x,y)$, the local influence of a support vector in prediction at a particular data point.\n",
